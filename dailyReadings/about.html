          <h1>What is the Lectionary?</h1>
          <p>A lectionary, according to Wikipedia, is "a book or listing that contains a collection of
            scripture readings appointed for Christian or Judaic worship on a given day or occasion."
            Essentially, it's a calendar for when to read certain scriptures, like a year-round
            reading plan.</p>
          <p>Many of these lectionaries have been put together over centuries; among Christian circles,
            a handful of widely-used lectionaries remain. The most widely-used and modified lectionary
            is the Roman Catholic Mass Lectionary, which provides readings for Sunday Mass as well as
            Daily Mass during the week - this site provides the RCML reading for the current day, with references
            pulled from the <a href="https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/daily-readings">EWTN daily readings</a>
            and scripture pulled from <a href="https://bible-api.com/">Bible-API</a>.</p>

          <h1>What do the colors mean?</h1>
          <p>The primary background reflects the color of the current liturgical season: purple for Advent & Lent,
            gold for Christmas & Easter, red for Holy Week & Pentecost, and green for Ordinary Time.</p>
          <p>The color of the title also reflects the current liturgical season, with, red also signifying
            a feast day (also signalled by a subtitle below the date in the sidebar.)</p>
