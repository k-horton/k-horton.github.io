          <p><em>There's something rotten in the state of the humanitarian sector.</em> And it isn't the hearts of
          the men and women working tirelessly to find solutions for problems like poor water quality or
          sanitation--through no fault of their own, some solutions haven't stayed permanent.</p>

          <p>Projects like digging a well in an impoverished African village or building latrines for a
          small community in Latin America can be life-changing for the people affected--but too often we count
          the installation a success without checking in on the aftermath; and we're finding that our
          solutions aren't as sustainable as we'd hoped. Pictured to the right is a water tapstand installed
          in Peru--unused and beginning to corrode. There are countless stories of similarly unused projects:
          wells dried up, sewage systems untouched, community maintenance groups disbanded.</p>

          <p><em>What's going wrong?</em> There's not an easy answer--each community's story is different,
          and so are the factors affecting the sustainability of new developments. That's where the process of
          <strong>Iterative Factor-Mapping and Learning</strong> (IFML) comes in.</p>
