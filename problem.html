        <p>I am a Christian, student, and programmer in Portland, Oregon with homes around the world in Malaysia, Jordan, and across the United States.</p>
        <p>I am a lifelong follower of Christ, and I believe his call to serve the poor and underprivileged was meant to be taken seriously. I also believe there is great need in the humanitarian sector for technical experience to come alongside existing efforts in communication and fieldwork; I seek to use my technical experience to bring efficiency and new solutions to those already on the front lines fighting for justice and human flourishing.</p>
        <p>Technology is a powerful tool, and I believe it should be harnessed and stewarded responsibly to the benefit of the world at large. I hope to be a part of the movements working for justice and against suffering by learning to steward technology rightly and using it to advance quality of life around the world.</p>
