          <h1>Grand Challenge Scholars Program | An Overview</h1>
          <p>The Grand Challenge Scholars Program (GCSP) is an initiative for students in K-12 and
            engineering schools to engage with the National Academy of Engineering's (NAE) 14 "grand challenges,"
            or goals that the NAE recognized as necessary to deliver their vision, <strong>“Continuation of life on
            the planet, making our world more sustainable, secure, healthy, and joyful.”</strong></p>
          <p>As a student in the GCSP, I'm doing work towards two of these challenges that fulfills the key competencies of the program:
            academic ("talent"), multicultural, entrepreneurial, multidisciplinary, and socially conscientious. For more
            details about my research and the different competencies that have gone into it, check out the links in the sidebar;
            and if you want to learn a little bit more about who I am, keep scrolling!</p>

          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hey there! My name is Kimberly, and I'm a senior Computer Science major at George Fox University.</p>
          <p>The first thing you should know about me is that <strong>I like to keep myself busy</strong>; over the course of my high school years, I’ve been on my school’s
            parliamentary debate team, an actress in multiple school productions, a soundboard runner at my church,
            and taught myself tuba, guitar, saxophone, and euphonium. In university, I’ve been in Drumline, Pep Band,
            George Fox’s nationally-recognized Symphonic Band (playing the euphonium & tuba), multiple choirs,
            and am a student in the university’s <a href="https://www.georgefox.edu/honors-program/index.html">George Fox Honors Program</a>,
            a Socratic seminar-style Great Books program.</p>
          <p><strong>My home is international.</strong> I’m an alumnus of <a href="http://www.dalat.org/">Dalat International School</a>
            in Penang, Malaysia, where I attended middle school and high school; and for the first three months of 2020, I lived in Amman, Jordan
            as a student in the CCCU's Middle East Studies Program.</p>

                <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
                <p>I am a Christian, student, and programmer in Portland, Oregon with homes around the world in Malaysia, Jordan, and across the United States.</p>
                <p>I am a lifelong follower of Christ, and I believe his call to serve the poor and underprivileged was meant to be taken seriously. I also believe there is great need in the humanitarian sector for technical experience to come alongside existing efforts in communication and fieldwork; I seek to use my technical experience to bring efficiency and new solutions to those already on the front lines fighting for justice and human flourishing.</p>
                <p>Technology is a powerful tool, and I believe it should be harnessed and stewarded responsibly to the benefit of the world at large. I hope to be a part of the movements working for justice and against suffering by learning to steward technology rightly and using it to advance quality of life around the world.</p>
