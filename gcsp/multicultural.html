          <h1>Multicultural Experience</h1>
          <h2>Malaysia</h2>
            <p>Perhaps my most "multicultural" experience is one entirely disconnected from
              my university education; I grew up on a small island called Penang, off the Western
              coast of Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
            <p>Penang is one of the greatest examples I can think of (though I'm a little biased)
              of a cultural melting pot. The population of Malaysia consists primarily of ethnic
              Chinese and Indian descent, with more Indigenous peoples living in the rural areas,
              and the cultures intermingle in everything from the tastes of the food to the
              sounds of the temples, mosques, and monasteries across the island. We get tourists,
              businessmen and their families, missionaries, and everyone in between; my high school
              graduating class had 13 different nationalities alone.</p>
            <p>I have both the blessing and the curse of having grown up in such a diverse place;
              it's a blessing because I learned to navigate cultures and customs intuitively, and
              a curse because it makes explaining those intuitions to others a little difficult.</p>
