          <h2>George Fox Honors Program</h2>
            <p>Easily one of the most influential aspects of my education, the
            <a href="https://www.georgefox.edu/honors-program/index.html">George Fox Honors Program</a> is a
            Great Books curriculum that has walked my graduating class through four years of texts that
            have shaped history. Topics range from philosophy to economics, from Homer's <em>Iliad</em>
            to Sartre's <em>Existentialism is a Humanism</em>, and we discuss a different text twice a week
            in a rountable, Socratic format.</p>
            <p>Now, while picking up a copy of Augustine or Descartes is usually not a direct map onto engineering
            or research work, the skills I have picked up over the course of this program are ones
            I will always find invaluable: I've learned to contribute well to group discussions,
            to think critically about nuanced ideas, and to hold different opinions and schools of thought
            in my head and discuss them articulately. In global humanitarian work,
            it is a guarentee that you will have interactions with people different than yourself. I believe
            it is imperative that we be able to have meaningful, progressive conversations about the
            nuanced issues we work with in this field, and my time in the Honors Program has given me a
            passion for thoughtful communication.

          <h2>Computer Science</h2>
            <p>The spectrum of experience I've had during my time in George Fox's Computer Science department
            is incredibly wide and absolutely invaluable. The courses have fairly standard content: data structures,
            design patterns, databases; but what's really made the experience has been our faculty.</p>
            <p>I wouldn't have switched into a CSIS major without the <strike>pressure</strike> encouragement
            of multiple professors in the department--and once I switched, the care they had for me personally
            didn't go away just because I'd 'converted'. I've felt like I've had people to go to for advice
            every step of the way, and I can honestly say I've never once doubted my decision to switch.</p>
